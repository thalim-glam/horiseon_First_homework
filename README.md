This is the first homework for HTML/CSS/Git module. I have updated the "Starter-code" I copied from "Develop" folder. To complete my homework, I followed the class guidelines and watched the recordings for better understanding. I also joined study group for support.

- My motivation was to finish my homework
- Because it was a homework assignment.
- It is updating an existing webpage.
